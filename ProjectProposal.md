# Asset Allocation

Asset allocation is the rigorous implementation of an investment strategy that attempts to
balance risk versus reward. In my case we will be using the data set provided by my 
supervisor (Shan He). The goal of my project is to create a piece of software which will
take some standard input about the level of acceptable risk, the size of their portfolio,
and the time frame in which they are willing to invest in. It will then use these parameters
to then analyze the shares inside the dataset so that the software can then determine 
the optimum allocation of the portfolio. It will be able to back test against the older
data to show the user how successful it would be on each year, and possibly how to allocate
the assets as the market changes.

## Preliminary Analysis

In section I will analyze the current systems which are already available to do asset allocation.
As of my initial research I can see that there is several websites and services which offer a
similar product to my initial idea. 

Automated solutions: Some ask questions to gauge the risk you are willing to
accept. Such as: age, type of investment, current income, current available assets, and 
others. It then uses these answers to determine the level of acceptable risk, and then 
determines a ratio in which your assets are distributed. Furthermore most of them then charge
a percentage based free to then actually fulfill the described ratio, so that your assets
are actually making money. They rely on automation and low fees, so that they can appeal to the widest audience, allowing
them to make back their money in quantity instead of quality.

Manual solutions: This is contrast to the previous solution, it does a more personal
analysis of risk, and then determines a ratio with human interaction. They essentially
offer a higher quality investment as they claim larger returns with lower risk, hence
charging higher fees. But it comes with the obvious drawbacks and advantages of working with
a human.

Hence their might be scope for my project to exist, if I can do what the automated solutions
do but better or with lower fees it would be a viable tool for actual use. This is probably
too ambitious for 1 person to try and compete with full teams of professional developers.
But I believe by narrowing the scope of the possible investments to just the stocks in the
database, I believe a viable solution would be feasible with this restriction.
