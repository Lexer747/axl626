\section{Kelly Criterion}

Kelly criterion is a well known concept for the most optimal way to grow a budget from a given
gamble. In the case where there is a positive expectation gamble, then using the Kelly criterion
is mathematically proven to be optimal. Based on the paper which under the guise of networking
formally defines the optimal growth rate of a betting function with a fixed probability and
payout.\newline

\[ k = \frac{(b \cdot p - (1 - p))}{b} \]

where:\newline
\(k =\) The best size as a fraction of your portfolio\newline
\(b =\) The net odds on the wager. i.e. your win \(b + wager staked\) \newline
\(p =\) The probability of winning

This has one clear difference to real stocks and investment which is that you are assumed to lose 100\% of your wager upon a loss. 
Which while technically true in the worst case for a stock or bond investment. Is more often than not, not what happens. 
Typically you lose a smaller percentage than 100\%. Hence there is an adapted formula: \cite{Alon}
