# Week 1

Email supervisor to arrange a meeting to discuss project ideas, proceed to meet with supervisor
to discuss ideas around algorithmic trading. He showed me a large dataset which contains data
and features about various US companies an their shares.

# Week 2

No progress made.

# Week 3 

Had a meeting with my supervisor and we discussed my project more in depth, I now need to work
on my project proposal. The basic idea is asset allocation, given a budget/portfolio and
time-frame, create an investment strategy which balances the risk versus reward. This method 
will have focus on taking best advantage of the overall portfolio rather than which specific
shares will be most profitable.

# Week 4

Starting work on project proposal.
